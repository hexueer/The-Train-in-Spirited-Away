            On this page, we have begun to build out a scene from the animated film <i>Spirited Away</i> which was directed by Hayao Miyazaki. 
            This is the scene where a train that travels is arriving at a "bus stop" in the middle of a body of water to bring the main character to her destination. 

            <br><br>
            We have built out the main components of the train's exterior and interior, implemented water using a plane mapped with mirror-like material, and also built the train tracks (made from box geometries) on top of a rock path (texture mapped). 

            <br><br>
            In particular, the train is a fairly complex object in our scene since we used a Three CSG (constructive solid geometry) library to transform and merge multiple geometries, which gave us wonderful features like windows that are actually cut out of the train.

            <br><br>
            In the inspiration images, the rock path can be seen clearly in shallow water but the texture slowly tapers off in the distance. To mimic this effect and create a similar illusion of depth, we layered multiple texture-mapped transparent planes with increasing levels of opacity, the narrowest one in the center down to the widest one which can be seen at either edge. This layering technique gave us the desired tapering effect, especially with the blurring from the moving water underneath.

            <br><br>
            The animation of the train has also been implemented so that it slows down, stops at the platform, the doors proceed to open and close, and then slowly moves again. This is repeated in a continuous cycle. 

            <br><br>
            Users can change the camera perspective by pressing the 'a' key to view the train from the side, the 's' key to follow the train as it moves, the 'd' key to stand at the platform, the 'f' key to turn the headlights on and off, the 'g' key to stand inside the train, and the 'h' key to step forward while inside the train. 

            <br><br>
            Another fantastic feature is the audio (the famous score from <i>Spirited Away</i>) that plays immediately upon loading the page.
